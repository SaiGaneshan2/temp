### 2. Frontend: Better Line Visibility
**File**: `IntegratedMatchGame.jsx`

**Changes**:

#### A. Curved Bezier Lines (Instead of Straight)
```javascript
// Before: Straight lines
ctx.lineTo(endX, endY)

// After: Smooth curved lines
ctx.bezierCurveTo(controlX1, controlY1, controlX2, controlY2, endX, endY)
```

**Benefits**:
- Lines don't overlap as much
- Easier to trace from question to answer
- More visually appealing
- Natural flow

#### B. Thicker Lines with Shadow
```javascript
// Before
lineWidth: 3

// After
lineWidth: 4
shadowColor: color
shadowBlur: 8
```

**Benefits**:
- Much easier to see
- Glowing effect
- Clear distinction between colors
- Better contrast

#### C. Larger Connection Dots
```javascript
// Before
ctx.arc(startX, startY, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2)

// After
ctx.arc(startX, startY, 6, 0, Math.PI * 2)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear start/end points
- Easy to see where line connects
- Better visual feedback

#### D. Updated Colors
```javascript
// Before
Correct: '#00ff00' (bright neon green)
Wrong: '#ff6b6b' (soft red)

// After
Correct: '#28a745' (Bootstrap green - professional)
Wrong: '#dc3545' (Bootstrap red - professional)
```

**Benefits**:
- More professional look
- Better match with answer box colors
- Consistent color scheme
- Easier on eyes

### 3. CSS: Better Spacing
**File**: `IntegratedGame.css`

**Changes**:

#### A. Increased Gap Between Items
```css
/* Before */
gap: 10px;

/* After */
gap: 15px;
```

#### B. Increased Item Padding
```css
/* Before */
padding: 12px;

/* After */
padding: 15px;
```

#### C. Added Minimum Height
```css
/* New */
min-height: 60px;
```

**Benefits**:
- Lines spread out more vertically
- Less convergence at connection points
- Easier to distinguish individual lines
- More breathing room

## Visual Comparison 🎨

### Before (10 questions, straight lines):
```
Questions          Answers
1. Q1 ────────────→ A. Ans1
2. Q2 ─────────────→ B. Ans2  ← Lines converging
3. Q3 ────────────→  C. Ans3  ← Hard to see
4. Q4 ─────────────→ D. Ans4
...10 more items...  ← Crowded!
```

### After (5 questions, curved lines):
```
Questions              Answers

1. Q1  ╭─────────╮    A. Ans1
         ╰───────╯
2. Q2  ╭──────────╮   B. Ans2
          ╰────────╯
3. Q3  ╭───────────╮  C. Ans3   ← Clear curves
          ╰─────────╯
4. Q4  ╭────────────╮ D. Ans4   ← Easy to see
           ╰────────╯
5. Q5  ╭─────────────╮E. Ans5   ← Well spaced
```

## Line Drawing Algorithm 📐

### Bezier Curve Calculation:
```javascript
const controlX1 = startX + (endX - startX) * 0.33
const controlY1 = startY
const controlX2 = startX + (endX - startX) * 0.67
const controlY2 = endY
```

**How it works**:
1. Control point 1 (33% across): Same Y as start
2. Control point 2 (67% across): Same Y as end
3. Creates smooth S-curve
4. Natural horizontal flow
5. Prevents sharp angles

### Visual Representation:
```
Start (Q1) ●
            ╲
             ╲  (Control Point 1)
              ╲
               ─── (Control Point 2)
                  ╲
                   ╲
                    ● End (Ans)
```
