# Game Behavior Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Slower Target Drop Speed
**Changed:** Reduced target falling speed from 50 to 30 pixels/second

```javascript
this.targetSpeed = 30  // Previously 50, originally 80
```

**Result:** Targets now float down much more gently, giving players more time to read and aim.

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Text Sticking to UI
**Problem:** Text objects from previous questions were staying on screen, creating visual clutter

**Solution:** When any target is hit (correct or wrong), ALL targets and their text objects are now properly destroyed:

```javascript
// Destroy ALL targets and their text objects
this.targets.getChildren().forEach(t => {
  if (t.textObject) {
    t.textObject.destroy()  // Clean up text
  }
  t.destroy()  // Clean up target
})
this.targets.clear(true, true)  // Clear the group
```

**Result:** Clean screen transitions between questions - no leftover text!

---

### 3. ✅ No Second Chances - One Shot Per Question
**Problem:** Players could keep trying after hitting wrong answer

**Solution:** Changed `handleWrongAnswer()` to:
1. Destroy ALL remaining targets (not just the wrong one)
2. Move to next question immediately
3. Updated feedback message to "✗ Wrong! Moving to next..."

**Before:**
```javascript
handleWrongAnswer(target) {
  // Only destroyed the wrong target
  target.textObject.destroy()
  target.destroy()
  // Player could try again with remaining targets
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
handleWrongAnswer(target) {
  // Destroy ALL targets
  this.targets.getChildren().forEach(t => {
    if (t.textObject) t.textObject.destroy()
    t.destroy()
  })
  
  // Move to next question
  this.currentPairIndex++
  // Spawn new targets
}
```

**Result:** Once you shoot ANY target (correct or wrong), the question ends and you move to the next one.

## Summary of Behavior Changes

### Before:
- ❌ Targets dropping at speed 50 (still a bit fast)
- ❌ Text from previous questions sticking to screen
- ❌ Could keep trying after wrong answer
- ❌ Visual clutter from leftover targets

### After:
- ✅ Targets dropping at speed 30 (much slower and gentler)
- ✅ All text properly cleaned up between questions
- ✅ One shot per question - immediate progression
- ✅ Clean, smooth transitions
- ✅ Better game pacing and challenge

## Game Flow Now

```
1. Question appears with 4 targets
   ↓
2. Player shoots a target
   ↓
3. ALL targets disappear (with explosion effect)
   ↓
4. Feedback shown: "✓ Correct!" or "✗ Wrong! Moving to next..."
   ↓
5. Next question appears after 1 second
   ↓
6. Repeat until all questions completed
```

---

## Speed Progression
- **Original:** 80 pixels/second (too fast)
- **First fix:** 50 pixels/second (better but still fast)
- **Current:** 30 pixels/second (slow and readable) ✅

## Testing Notes

The frontend development server should automatically reload with these changes. If not:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3001 (or whatever port Vite shows) and test:

1. ✅ Targets should fall very slowly
2. ✅ Shoot a target (any target)
3. ✅ All 4 targets should disappear
4. ✅ No text should remain on screen
5. ✅ Next question should appear after 1 second
6. ✅ Score increases only on correct answers

## Configuration

If you want to adjust the speed further:

**In `MatchGameScene.js`:**
```javascript
this.targetSpeed = 30  // Lower = slower, Higher = faster
```

**Recommended ranges:**
- **Very slow:** 20-30 (current)
- **Medium:** 40-60
- **Fast:** 70-100

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/game/MatchGameScene.js`
  - Line ~24: Changed `targetSpeed` to 30
  - Lines ~290-310: Updated `handleCorrectAnswer()` to clean all targets
  - Lines ~325-350: Updated `handleWrongAnswer()` to clean all targets and progress
