# Phaser Game Fixes - Text Wrapping and Physics

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Wrapping and Readability ✅

**Problem:**
- Answer text was unreadable and overflowing the target containers
- Text was being manually wrapped with a custom function that wasn't working well

**Solution:**
- Added `useAdvancedWrap: true` to the wordWrap configuration
- Changed from manual text wrapping to Phaser's built-in word wrapping
- Updated text configuration to use proper wrapping:

```javascript
const textObj = this.add.text(x, y, definition, {
  fontSize: '12px',
  fill: '#ffffff',
  fontFamily: 'Arial',
  align: 'center',
  wordWrap: { width: 120, useAdvancedWrap: true }  // ✅ Fixed
}).setOrigin(0.5)
```

**Benefits:**
- Text now wraps properly within the 140px wide target boxes
- `useAdvancedWrap: true` ensures words break intelligently
- Text remains centered and readable

### 2. Target Physics and Movement ✅

**Problem:**
- Targets were moving too fast (velocity: 80)
- Targets were overlapping each other
- No collision detection between targets

**Solution:**

#### A. Reduced Target Speed
```javascript
this.targetSpeed = 50  // Reduced from 80
```

#### B. Added Collider Between Targets
```javascript
// In create() method, after creating targets group
this.physics.add.collider(this.targets, this.targets)
```

#### C. Improved Bounce Physics
```javascript
// Set bounce to 1 for realistic bouncing
target.setBounce(1)

// Enable collision with world bounds
target.body.setCollideWorldBounds(true)
```

#### D. Added Horizontal Variation
```javascript
// Add slight horizontal movement for more natural floating
const horizontalVelocity = Phaser.Math.Between(-30, 30)
target.body.setVelocity(horizontalVelocity, this.targetSpeed)
```

#### E. Fixed Respawn Logic
```javascript
// When target goes off-screen, reset velocity properly
if (target.y > this.cameras.main.height + 100) {
  target.y = -50
  target.x = Phaser.Math.Between(100, this.cameras.main.width - 100)
  const horizontalVelocity = Phaser.Math.Between(-30, 30)
  target.body.setVelocity(horizontalVelocity, this.targetSpeed)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Targets move slower and more gracefully (50 instead of 80)
- Targets bounce off each other realistically
- Targets bounce off screen edges
- No more overlapping targets
- More natural, varied movement patterns

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Text Readability**
- [ ] Text wraps within target boxes
- [ ] No text overflow
- [ ] Text remains centered
- [ ] Long definitions are readable

✅ **Target Physics**
- [ ] Targets move slower and more smoothly
- [ ] Targets bounce off each other
- [ ] Targets bounce off screen edges
- [ ] No overlapping targets
- [ ] Movement looks natural and varied

✅ **Gameplay**
- [ ] Player can still shoot targets
- [ ] Collision detection still works
- [ ] Score increases on correct hits
- [ ] Game progresses through all pairs

## Before vs After

### Before:
- ❌ Text overflowing containers
- ❌ Targets moving at speed 80 (too fast)
- ❌ Targets overlapping each other
- ❌ No collision between targets
- ❌ Only vertical movement (boring)

### After:
- ✅ Text wraps properly with `useAdvancedWrap: true`
- ✅ Targets moving at speed 50 (gentle)
- ✅ Targets bounce off each other
- ✅ Collider active: `this.physics.add.collider(this.targets, this.targets)`
- ✅ Horizontal variation for natural movement
- ✅ Full bounce enabled with `setBounce(1)`
- ✅ Targets stay within screen bounds

## Next Steps

To test the changes:

1. **Restart the frontend** (if it's running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Upload a PDF** and generate a game

3. **Observe**:
   - Text should be readable and properly wrapped
   - Targets should move slowly and bounce naturally
   - No overlapping targets

4. **If further adjustments needed**:
   - Adjust `targetSpeed` (currently 50) - lower = slower
   - Adjust horizontal velocity range (currently -30 to 30)
   - Adjust `wordWrap.width` (currently 120) for text wrapping

## Technical Details

### Word Wrapping Configuration
```javascript
wordWrap: { 
  width: 120,              // Slightly less than target width (140px)
  useAdvancedWrap: true    // Intelligent word breaking
}
```

### Physics Configuration
```javascript
// Target settings
target.setBounce(1)                           // 100% elastic collision
target.body.setCollideWorldBounds(true)       // Bounce off screen edges
target.body.setVelocity(horizontalX, verticalY)  // Initial velocity

// Collider between all targets
this.physics.add.collider(this.targets, this.targets)
```

### Movement Pattern
- **Vertical velocity**: 50 pixels/second (downward)
- **Horizontal velocity**: Random between -30 and +30 pixels/second
- **Result**: Gentle floating motion with slight drift
